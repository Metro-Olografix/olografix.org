**Required materials** (all provided by the instructor):

- Various types of transceivers
- Spectrum analyzer
- Laptop for demonstrations

**Workshop content**

- Theory of signal propagation
- Brief history of telecommunications
- Why "modulation" is necessary
- Telegraphy
- Amplitude modulation (AM) and its efficiency challenges
- Frequency modulation (FM)
- Digital modulations (FSK, PSK, QAM)
- Practical radiofrequency exercises

**Duration**: 2 hours
