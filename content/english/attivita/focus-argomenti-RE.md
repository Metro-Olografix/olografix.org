#### **ðŸ“… Date to be defined**

#### **Description**
During the intro to reversing, a review of technical topics was made, organized by macro areas, to study and necessary to be able to reverse without going crazy; we could do "focus" meetings on each of these macro areas (windows internals, compilers/languages, assembly, etc). Gathering some feedback and feelings from the workshop done, it seems interesting as an idea to give a follow-up by dedicating a few hours to each topic, to have time to think and discuss the technical problems together.

**Necessary material**:
 - If you can, bring your usual PC with a Windows 10 virtual machine.

**Duration**:
 - Spread over several weekends: we can do one topic in the morning and the other in the afternoon, or one all afternoon until evening. To be decided.

 **Recurring**:
 - At least 4/5 focuses, which divided by 2 are 2 meetings, while doing it one at a time are 4/5 meetings.

**Cost**: A minimum contribution of **5 euros** is required for participation, this helps us to support the activities of the association. For members, participation is **free**.
