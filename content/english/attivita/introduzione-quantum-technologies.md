#### **Description**
A comprehensive journey into the world of **quantum technologies**, designed to engage both the general public and those seeking more technical insights.

The activity is structured in two complementary parts:
- **Educational talk**: A dive into the **quantum realm**.
- **Technical mini-course**: Hands-on deepening and principles of quantum technologies (date to be determined).

The **educational talk** will be a true general introduction to quantum technologies, designed to be accessible to everyone. No equations, just concepts and future possibilities.

**Required materials**:
- None.

**Note**, the workshop is free but if you wish and are able, you can leave a voluntary donation that will help the association self-finance and organize other activities :)
