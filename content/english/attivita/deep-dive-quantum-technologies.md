#### **Description**

Mini-course in which I talk about quantum mechanics and use it to explain some of the principles of various quantum technologies (quantum computing, quantum communication, quantum sensing). I don't think any mathematical knowledge is necessary from the audience except for the four operations and raising to power.

**Duration**: 8 hours total, divided into 2 Saturdays or Sundays.

**Necessary material**:
 - None.

**Cost**: A minimum contribution of **5 euros** is required for participation, this helps us support the association's activities. Participation is **free** for members.
