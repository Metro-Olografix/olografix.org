#### **ðŸ•’ Time to be defined**

#### **Description**

A technical day dedicated to the world of embedded devices and hardware analysis techniques. We'll uncover the hidden secrets in our everyday devices through theory and hands-on practice.

**What we'll do:**

We'll analyze routers and IoT devices, learn to identify debug interfaces, extract and analyze firmware (and maybe even modify it), and have fun with OpenWrt on some device you might already have at home.

**What to bring:**

* TTL-USB adapter (like CH340G, CP2102 or FTDI)
* A computer
* An embedded device you DON'T care about (old router, IP cam, etc.) - it might not survive! ðŸ˜ˆ

**Cost**: A minimum contribution of **5 euros** is required for participation; this helps support the associationâ€™s activities. Participation is **free** for members.
