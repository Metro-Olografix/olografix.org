#### **ðŸ•’ Time to be defined**

#### **Description**  
The idea is not to use too many slides (however, the functioning of a serial port will be explained) but to **really** work with the hardware.  
Some key-points we will cover:

 - We will focus on the most commonly used protocols for debugging embedded hardware (UART, SPI, JTAG).

 - We will try to debug a test hardware (probably a Zyxel T56 but I am open to suggestions) and try to understand whatâ€™s interesting in the original firmware.

 - We will attempt to dump flash and NAND memory and try to extract their content in human-readable mode.

**Required materials**:  
 - A serial-to-USB adapter (necessary if you also have hardware you want to debug together), a computer, and lots of curiosity.

**Cost**: A minimum contribution of **5 euros** is required for participation; this helps support the associationâ€™s activities. Participation is **free** for members.
