Deep dive into a legendary intrusion that made history: [Phineas Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Fisher)'s attack on the Catalan police union (Mossos d'Esquadra).

– **nearly impossible to find video of the attack**  
– **live step-by-step analysis**: from an SQL vulnerability to total server control  
– **accessible explanation** even for those not familiar with cybersecurity  
– **hands-on mini-lab**, if there's time and willingness to get your hands dirty

An evening for curious people, technical and non-technical, who want to understand how a hacker attack really works 🏴‍☠️
