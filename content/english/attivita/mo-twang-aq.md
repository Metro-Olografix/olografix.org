#### **Description**

A two-day practical workshop dedicated to the design and self-construction of an interactive arcade game that combines electronics, programming, and recycled materials.

We will build a physical game together using low-cost electronic components and easily available reclaimed materials. Participants will work in groups to assemble, program, and customize the game.

**Program:**

**Day 1 (Saturday, December 13, 3:00 PM-6:00 PM) - A bit of theory and design**
- Basic electronics: programmable boards, LEDs, sensors
- Thinking like a hacker: transforming common objects into technological components
- Design with reclaimed materials (boxes, containers, PVC pipes)
- First practical trials and component testing

**Day 2 (Sunday, December 14, 3:00 PM-6:00 PM) - Construction and game time**
- Construction of the physical structure using recycled materials
- Electronic assembly and wiring
- Collaborative debugging
- Final tournament: everyone plays together!

**Who can participate:**

Open to **30 people** without distinction of age (approximately 15 years old and up) or background. No prior skills are needed: the approach is inclusive and values everyone's contribution.

**What to bring:**

Nothing! All materials (electronic components, reclaimed materials, tools) are provided by Metro Olografix.

**Why participate:**

- Learn electronics and programming by doing
- Build with inexpensive materials against waste
- Create accessible sociality and community
- Take home DIY construction skills

**Cost:**
