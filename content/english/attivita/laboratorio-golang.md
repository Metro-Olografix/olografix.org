The Golang workshop is designed as a collective learning experience, where we'll approach the basics of the language and get our hands dirty with code.

**What you need**:

- Yourself
- If you have one, bring a laptop (no need to have Golang installed)
- Don't have a PC? Don't worry! We have a limited number of Microsoft Surface Go devices that will be provided during the workshop.

**Workshop contents**:

- We'll start with Go basics, how it works and how it differs from other languages
- We'll discover the advantages of concurrency in Go and the goroutine model
- We'll explore error handling and the type system
- We'll tackle exercises based on real-world use cases
- Coding challenges in Go
- Development of a small practical project (REST API, CLI tool, or microservice)

**Who is it for**:
- Those who want to approach the world of programming
- Developers with experience in other languages who want to expand their skills
- Professionals interested in the performance and simplicity of Golang

**When**: every two weeks on Wednesday from 6:30 PM, starting April 16

**Duration**: approximately 2 hours

**Note**, the workshop is free, but if you want and are able, you can leave a donation that will help the association self-finance and organize other activities :)
