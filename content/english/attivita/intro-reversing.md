## Daily Program

### **Session 1: Soft introduction to software reversing**
**Morning - from 10 to 12**

#### **Objective**  
The workshop's goal is to share which topics (and why they matter) a beginner should study independently to approach a RE session with more confidence and fewer rabbit holes; approaches, technical concepts, and study resources will be shared. The workshop is for beginners and curious minds - it doesn't replace technical courses or personal practice but tries to fill the gap between 0 and 0x90, which is often overlooked.

**Required materials**:
 - If you can, bring a PC with a Windows 10 virtual machine

**Duration: 2 hours**

**Cost**: A minimum contribution of **5 euros** is required for participation, this helps us support the association's activities. For members, participation is **free**.

### **Session 2: Introduction to malware analysis**
**Afternoon - from 15 to 17**

#### **Objective**
A client requests the analysis of an executable involved in an incident, presumably malware, responsible for encrypting company documents: in this context, we'll provide an overview of the tools that can help us, which techniques to use, and what information is useful to extract and then share internally and externally. Note: this workshop is an afternoon introduction for beginners - it's aimed at those who want to start getting their hands dirty and experimenting.

**Required materials**:
 - If you can, bring a PC with a Windows 10 virtual machine

**Duration: afternoon, approximately 2 hours**

**Cost**: A minimum contribution of **5 euros** is required for participation, this helps us support the association's activities. For members, participation is **free**.
