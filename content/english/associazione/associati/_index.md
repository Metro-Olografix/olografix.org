The payment methods are simple:

- PayPal to the address [info@olografix.org](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/olografix) (if possible, please add the commission cost so that Metro Olografix doesn't have to bear it)

## Why become a member?

Because you share the hacker spirit; because you like Metro Olografix's activities; because you want to contribute to the association's life as you can; because you enjoy coming to chat at the headquarters on Monday evenings :)

As you can see, there are many reasons! **Additionally, as a member, it is your right to participate in assemblies and vote.**

If you haven't already done so, take two minutes to read the association's statutes, particularly [Art. 5 - rights and duties of members](/associazione/statuto/#art-5--diritti-e-doveri-dei-soci).

And on top of it all, with an extra contribution of **3 euros** you can receive your own physical **member card!**, depicted below.

We don't do shipping, but if you can't come to the HQ to fetch it send us an email and we can figure something out!
