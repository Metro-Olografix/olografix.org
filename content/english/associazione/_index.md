**Metro Olografix** is a living community, created to share and spread a passion for technology and information freedom. Founded in 1994 in **Pescara**, it promotes a pure and alternative idea of **telematics culture**, inspired by the pioneers of the BBS (Bulletin Board System), when the Internet was still an unexplored and fascinating territory.
<br /><br />
This association is based on profound principles of **free circulation of information**, **inclusion** and **participatory democracy**. Each member of the community brings his or her own knowledge, sharing it with others and contributing to a collective treasure of experience, knowledge and friendships. It is a place where interests and talents mingle, all united by a common vision: to use technology not only as a tool, but as a means to build a freer and more aware digital society.
<br /><br />
One of Metro Olografix's signature events is the **Metro Olografix Camp** (MOCA), a quadrennial gathering that brings together hackers and enthusiasts from around the world. At this camp, surrounded by nature, those who attend can explore topics of **privacy**, **cybersecurity** and **digital rights**, discovering that technology can still be a positive and transformative force. The atmosphere at MOCA is unique: a combination of **knowledge**, **creativity** and that dose of **constructive rebellion** that has characterized the history of hacking.
<br /><br />
Metro Olografix continues to engage on multiple fronts, offering free and accessible courses, promoting technological reconditioning with projects such as *Refurbish Ninja*, and fighting for responsible and safe use of the web. Over the years, this group has become a true **virtual family** that embraces anyone who shares the vision of a **free and open digital society**. A place where, as its members like to say, anyone can dream, create, discover and grow.
