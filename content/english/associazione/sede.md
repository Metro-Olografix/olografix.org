Since January 2025, Metro Olografix has opened a new space in Pescara!

It's a place to tinker, break things (and maybe fix them), learn from others and share what you know. Open to everyone, even if you've never touched a soldering iron.

## Address

We're located at **Viale Marconi 278/1**, near the Stadio Adriatico.
